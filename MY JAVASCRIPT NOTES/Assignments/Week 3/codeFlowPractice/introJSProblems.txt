let x = 3;
let y = 5;
x = y + 1; // Line 3
y = x + 1; // Line 4
x = y + 1; // Line 5
y = x + 1; // Line 6

// What is the value of x and y after line 3 executes?
    x is assigned the value of y + 1, so x becomes 6.
y remains 5

// What is the value of x and y after line 4 executes?
    y is assigned the value of x + 1, so y becomes 7.
x remains 6

// What is the value of x and y after line 5 executes?
x is assigned the value of y + 1, so x becomes 8.
y remains 7.

// What is the value of x and y after line 6 executes?
    y is assigned the value of x + 1, so y becomes 9.
x remains 8
